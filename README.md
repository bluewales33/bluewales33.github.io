# Project 1
**Title:** [Chennai Housing Sales](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Chennai%20houseing%20sale.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Micrososft Excel (Functions, Pivot Column, Power Query Editor and Vizualization tools)

**Project Descriptions:** This project involve analyzing housing sales data in Chennai. The dataset includes various attributes related to real estate transactions, such as: Area, Number of Rooms, Park Facilities, Build Type, Sale Condition, Date of Sale and Build, Registration Fee, Commission and Registration Fee.

**Key Findings:** 

Area (Total Sales Price by Area)

- High-Value Areas: Certain areas like Chrompet, Adyar, and Velachery might show significantly higher total sales prices, indicating that these are high-demand regions.
- Concentration of Sales: There could be a clear concentration of high-value transactions in specific areas, suggesting these might be more desirable for buyers, possibly due to factors like infrastructure, amenities, or proximity to key locations.

Park (Park Facilities and Sales Correlation)

- Impact of Park Facilities: Properties with park facilities might be associated with higher sales volumes or prices, indicating that access to green spaces is a valued feature for buyers.
- Distribution: If a large percentage of properties either have or do not have park facilities, this could indicate a trend in development or buyer preference in certain areas.

Number of Rooms (Rooms and Average Commission)

- Room Count Correlation: Properties with more rooms could be associated with higher commissions, suggesting a direct correlation between the size of the property and the revenue generated.
- Preference for Larger Homes: If properties with 3 or more rooms dominate the data, it might indicate a preference for larger homes in the Chennai housing market.

Build Type (Build Type, Street Type, and Commission Analysis)

- Commercial vs. Residential: Commercial properties might show different commission patterns compared to residential ones, indicating different profitability levels for real estate agents or developers.
- Street Type Influence: Properties on paved streets could show higher commissions or sales prices, highlighting the importance of infrastructure in real estate valuation.

Dates (Yearly Sales and Commission Trends)

- Yearly Trends: A visible trend in sales prices or commissions over the years could indicate market growth, stagnation, or fluctuations due to economic factors or policy changes.
- Peak Years: Certain years might stand out with unusually high sales or commissions, potentially linked to specific events (e.g., economic booms, new infrastructure projects, or favorable policies).

# Project 7
**Title:** [Wheather data analysis and forcasts](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Elveden%20Weather%20Forecast.R)

**Tools Used:** R Language Studio (imputeTS, ggplot2, Tmisc, tidyverse, Dplyr, tseries, forecast, randomForest, e1071)

**Project Descriptions:** This project aimed to analyze and predict the weather conditions at Elveden Farm by utilizing surface temperature data. The farm is particularly susceptible to temperature fluctuations, which can cause significant crop damage and stress to livestock. To mitigate these risks, advanced technology and data analysis are essential for accurately forecasting weather patterns. Following extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study evaluated various statistical and machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for predicting surface temperatures at the farm. The machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest, were developed and compared against the ARIMA statistical model certain metrics to determine the best-performing model.

**Results and Findings:** The ARIMA model demonstrated the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) among the models tested, indicating its superior accuracy in temperature forecasting. Consequently, the study concludes that implementing the ARIMA model will enable Elveden Farm to make more informed decisions concerning crop and livestock management.

# Project 8
**Title:** [INVESTIGATE A DATASET - [NO-SHOW APPOINTMENTS]](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Medical%20Appointments.ipynb)

**Tools Used:** Python - Jupyter notebook (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Project Descriptions:** This project analysed dataset that contains information for 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

**Results and Findings:** 

- The result above shows that 80% of the patients showed up, while 20% of the patients did not show up.

- We could say that there is no adequate correlation between gender alone and missing the appointment, as the proportion of male and female patients missing their appointments is the same as the general average.

- The proportion of Handicap patient showing up for appointment is almost the same thing as that of Non-handicap. Thus being Handicap only does not influence the 'No_show' for the appointment. neither does  SMS_received only influence the showing up of the patients for appointments.
