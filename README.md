# Project 8
**Title:** [INVESTIGATE A DATASET - [NO-SHOW APPOINTMENTS]](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Medical%20Appointments.ipynb)

**Tools Used:** Python - Jupyter notebook (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Project Descriptions:** This project analysed dataset that contains information for 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

**Results and Findings:** 

- The result above shows that 80% of the patients showed up, while 20% of the patients did not show up.

- We could say that there is no adequate correlation between gender alone and missing the appointment, as the proportion of male and female patients missing their appointments is the same as the general average.

- The proportion of Handicap patient showing up for appointment is almost the same thing as that of Non-handicap. Thus being Handicap only does not influence the 'No_show' for the appointment. neither does  SMS_received only influence the showing up of the patients for appointments.

# Project 10
**Title:** [Loan Data from Prosper](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Loan%20Data%20from%20Prosper.ipynb)

**Tools Used:** Python - Jupyter notebook (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Project Descriptions:** This project, titled "Loan Data from Prosper" involves analyzing a dataset from Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform. The dataset comprises 113,937 loans and 81 variables, including details such as loan amounts, borrower interest rates, current loan statuses, borrower incomes, and various other attributes related to the loans and their borrowers.

**Results and Findings:** 

The focus of this analysis is on understanding the factors that contribute to successful loan repayment (LoanStatus). The findings indicate that higher StatedMonthlyIncome and lower BorrowerRate positively influence loan repayment. Additionally, employed individuals, particularly those with verifiable employment status, are more likely to complete their loan payments compared to unemployed or retired individuals. The analysis also confirms that high interest rates and not owning a home negatively impact loan repayment. Borrowers who own a home and have lower interest rates are more likely to complete their payments, even with higher loan amounts, especially when they have strong recommendations. There is also a partial negative correlation observed between the original loan amount and the borrower’s interest rate, where higher loan amounts are associated with lower interest rates.

# Project 11
**Title:** [Pizza Sales data](https://github.com/bluewales33/bluewales33.github.io/blob/main/Pizza%20Sales%20Forecasting.ipynb)

**Tools Used:** Python - Jupyter notebook (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning, Deep Learning)

**Project Descriptions:** The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model for forecasting pizza sales by considering various influencing factors. The project entails analyzing historical sales data and implementing regression models, machine learning models, deep learning models, and hybrid models to accurately predict future sales. Each model's performance was assessed using various metrics, and the best-performing model was deployed..

**Results and Findings:** 

The findings from the "Pizza Sales Forecasting" project can be summarized as follows:

- Model Performance: Multiple models were tested, including linear regression, ridge regression, XGBoost, random forest, support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting, recurrent neural networks (RNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and a hybrid model combining different approaches.
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²).

- Best Performing Model: The hybrid model, which combined predictions from multiple models (such as gradient boosting and MLP), showed the best performance in terms of both MAE and R².
The hybrid model had the lowest MAE (0.77) and a high R² (0.90), indicating a strong fit to the actual sales data.

- Model Rankings: The models were ranked based on their MAE and R² scores.
The hybrid model outperformed other models, followed by random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost.
Traditional regression models like linear regression and ridge regression performed relatively worse compared to the more complex machine learning and deep learning models.
Deployment:

Based on the evaluation, the hybrid model, being the most accurate, was selected for deployment to predict future pizza sales.
These findings suggest that more sophisticated models, especially hybrid models combining the strengths of multiple algorithms, provide better accuracy in forecasting pizza sales compared to simpler models.
